Layout containers for iOS

Apple's autolayout is a powerful tool that can be used to solve UI layout issues across the myriad device form factors, but it's hard to debug, difficult to master, error-prone, and tedious.

Ever wish for something like Android's LinearLayout, GridLayout, etc? That's what Griddle aims to be.

LineLayout
==========

Linear layout, in either horizontal or vertical direction. Subviews are divided evenly across the available space. 

let grid = LineLayout()
